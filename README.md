This is one application that i'm building to study more about some tecnologies that I'm currently working on. With the exception of nodejs that is one tecnology that I will implement here only to study more about this tecnology.

I'm building yet, that's why I dont create the complete read-me.

I prented to finish this project using the following tecnologies:
- nodeJS
- TypeScript
- React
- Redux
- Styled Components
- Material UI
when I finish this project, I will edit this README.

thanks!!

If you're here, and I don't finish this project yet, you only have to download this repo and run the following commands:

1. npm/yarn install
2. yarn dev
